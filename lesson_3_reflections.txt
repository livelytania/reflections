When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is useful when you want to share you work with others.

-----------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to wait to update your local (i.e. Git) repository until the changes you've made in your remote repository are ready. Perhaps you're waiting on a review or input from another person.
